## Background in CS
I started programming when I was in middle school; I had just gotten heavily into Minecraft and
was inspired to learn some Java in order to make mods, such as [this one seen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RItRg9YCVz0), which was my last and most popular. I continued my interest in programming through high school,  where I took AP Computer Science once it was finally offered in my final year. 
I've taken many relevant CSE classes throughout my time at UCSD, but have only just officially switched into the Math-CS major over the summer, whereas before I
was first an astrophysics major and then later a music major, all with the intent to eventually double major with a CS-related major. Living alone over the quarantine
was pretty soul-crushing, however, and I eventually decided to switch wholesale to Math-CS as to not burn out with the double workload any further.

### Current Interests (Within CS)
I'm currently very broadly interested in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning. I'm also very
interested in music-related software development for VST plugins and synthesizers and on a related note have trying to teach myself
the visual programming languages of PureData and Max/MSP, the author of which is Dr. Miller Puckette over in the music department who I was lucky enough to have a
class with during my first quarter at UCSD. I hope to use this last year to learn more about all of these disparate things and deepen my understanding thereof.

This line of JS is a great source of potassium:
`("b"+"a"+ +"a"+"a").toLowerCase()`

## Outside Interests
I'm hugely passionate about genre fiction and music! My favorite book series is [ *The Kingkiller Chronicles* ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kingkiller_Chronicle) by Patrick Rothfuss; I also write fiction occasionally in my increasingly fleeting spare time and hope to someday have something good enough to publish.
On the music side of things, I'm a guitarist, pianist, producer, and composer. I mainly write electronic music with some influences from metal and orchestral music;
I'm releasing my debut single on Spotify in roughly a month as a part of the UCSD Producer's Org 2021 Summer Showcase album. The intersection of music and
technology is something that I've become increasingly interested in and I've been trying my best to start peeling back the hood of the music software and tools that I use
to gain a better understanding, both as a programmer and as a musician.

Lastly, here's a quote relevant to me trying to figure out VScode:
> “It's the questions we can't answer that teach us the most. They teach us how to think. If you give a man an answer, all he gains is a little fact. But give him a question and he'll look for his own answers.”
-Patrick Rothfuss, *The Wise Man's Fear*.
